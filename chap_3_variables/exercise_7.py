# What happens when you run the following code? Why?

NAME = 'Victor'
print('Good Morning, ' + NAME)
print('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME)
print('Good Evening, ' + NAME)

NAME = 'Nina'
print('Good Morning, ' + NAME)
print('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME)
print('Good Evening, ' + NAME)


# 'Victor' is greeted 3 times and then Nina as well. Python doesn't have true constants
